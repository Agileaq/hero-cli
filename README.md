# Hero-cli

Create Hero apps with no build configuration.

* [Getting Started](#getting-started) – How to create a new app.
* [User Guide](#user-guide) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Hero App.

Hero App works on Android, iOS, and Modem browser.<br>
If something doesn’t work please [file an issue](https://github.com/hero-mobile/hero-cli/issues/new).

## Quick Overview

```sh
npm install -g hero-mobile/hero-cli

hero init my-app
cd my-app/

npm install

```
Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

* `npm start` Start the application.
* `npm run mock` You can start the mock server during the development.
* `npm run build` When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with this command.

Run `npm start` and then open [http://localhost:4000/?state=http://localhost:4000/entry/login.html](http://localhost:4000/?state=http://localhost:4000/entry/login.html) to see your app.<br>

### Get Started Immediately

Hero-cli using [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to build the boudle for deployment while you don't need to install or configure them.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code. Just create a project, and you’re good to go.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install it once globally:

```sh
npm install -g hero-mobile/hero-cli
```

**You’ll need to have Node >= 4 on your machine**.

**We strongly recommend to use Node >= 6 and npm >= 3 for faster installation speed and better disk usage.** You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

### Creating an App

To create a new app, run:

```sh
hero init my-app
cd my-app
```

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and then you can run command `npm install` to install the dependencies manually:

```
├── mock/
│   └── ...
├── public
│   ├── ...
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src
│   ├── ...
│   ├── environments
│   │   ├── environment-dev.js
│   │   └── environment-prod.js
│   ├── index.html
│   └── index.js
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitattributes
├── .gitignore
├── .hero-cli.json
├── package.json
└── README.md
```
For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `src/index.html` is the entry page;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.
* `.hero-cli.json` is the configuration file for hero-cli build, it tell hero loads which configuration when you run command `hero start -e dev` or `hero build -e prod`(which is invoked by `npm start` or `npm build`) according to the value of `-e` parameter. For more build options please refer to [Build Options](#build-options).

You can delete or rename the other files.

* `mock` you can put your mock data here, which is convenient for you during development. See [Usage Here](https://github.com/hero-mobile/hero-cli/tree/master/template/mock).
* `public` assets like images inside this folder will **copied into the build folder untouched**. It will not be processed by Webpack.
* `src` For faster rebuilds, only files inside this folder are processed by Webpack. You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside this folder**, or Webpack won’t see them.
* `src/environments` where your configurations exists(this is configured in file `.hero-cli.json`, you can change it later) and access the configuration in JavaScript or HTML code. See [Adding Custom Environment Variables](#adding-custom-environment-variables).

You may curious about where is the `entry/login.html`. Yes, it's generated by Hero-cli. See [Generate HTML](#generate-html)

## User Guide

### Generate HTML

Any JS file meet the following 2 conditions will treat as JavaScript entry point.

* Object `class` or `function` exists in the JS file.
* `class` or `function` marked by [Decorator](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators/blob/master/README.md) `@Entry` from [hero-cli/decorator](https://github.com/hero-mobile/hero-cli/blob/master/decorator.js).

Which would cause a HTML file generated using Webpack plugin [html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin):

* Options specified in `@Entry(options)` will passed to `html-webpack-plugin` transparently.
* Destination of generated HTML file will keep the file path structure of the Javascript entry, or you can override it using the options provided by `html-webpack-plugin`.
* Generated HTML file can access the [Custom Environment Variables](custom-environment-variables).

Example:<br>
Below JS will generate a HTML file at `<build>/entry/login.html`, that's why we can visit [http://localhost:4000/entry/login.html](http://localhost:4000/entry/login.html).

```javascript
// content of file: src/entry/login.js
import { Entry } from 'hero-cli/decorator';
import { Component, Boot, Message } from 'hero-js';

var defaultUIViews = {

}
// class marked by @Entry
@Entry()
@Component({
  view: defaultUIViews
})
export class DecoratePage {

    @Boot
    bootstrap(data){
      console.log('Bootstrap successfully!')
    }

    @Message('__data.click && __data.click == "login"')
    loginHandler(data) {
      console.log('Send Login Request...')
    }
}

```

### Adding Custom Environment Variables



### Build Options

#### `hero start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4000/?state=http://localhost:4000/entry/login.html](http://localhost:4000/?state=http://localhost:4000/entry/login.html) to view it in the browser.

<img src='https://github.com/hero-mobile/hero-cli/blob/master/images/readme/hero-start.png?raw=true' width='600' alt='npm start'>

This command invoke `hero start -e <env>` underneath. You can run `hero start -h` for help<br>
The available `<env>` values come from keys configured in attribute `environments` in file `.hero-cli.json`.<br>
And then, hero-cli will load the corresponding configurations under folder `src/environments` according to the `<env>` value.<br>When start successfully, you can access those configurations via `process.env`.

In JavaScript code, you can use `process.env` to access it like this:

```javascript
console.log(process.env['My-Attribute-Key']);
```

Inside index.html, you can use it for similar purposes:

```html
<base href="%My-Attribute-Key%"/>
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="%My-Attribute-Key%/favicon.ico">
```

The page will reload if you make edits in folder `src`.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

#### `hero build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
It correctly bundles Hero App in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This command invoke `hero build -e <env>` underneath, The available `<env>` value as same as [npm start](#npm-start). And you can run `hero build -h` for more options as below.<br>

* -s<br>Build this project to standalone version, which to run in Native App environment. That's to say, build version without libarary like [webcomponent polyfills](https://www.polymer-project.org/) or [hero-js](https://github.com/hero-mobile/hero-js) which is necessary when Hero App run in web browser.

* -m<br>Build this project without sourcemap

##### Building for Relative Paths
By default, Hero-cli produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.
To override this, specify the value([Valid Values see Webpack#publicPath](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#output-publicpath)) of key `__homepage`(This name is preserved for this purpose) in your configuration file in `src/environments`.

for example:

```

var environment = {
    __homepage: 'http://mywebsite.com/relativepath'
};

module.exports = environment;

```
This will let Hero App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.


Example:

```javascript
//  content of .hero-cli.json
{
  "environments": {
    "dev": "src/environments/environment-dev.js",
    "prod": "src/environments/environment-prod.js"
  }
}


```
